## Exam Time Tabling in a University
### Problem Definition:
Exam time tabling problems is defined as assigning a set of exams E = e1, e2, ... ee into a limited number of ordered timeslots (time periods) T = t1, t2, ... tt and rooms of certain
capacity in each timeslot C = C1, C2, ...Ct, subject to a set of constraints.<br>
#### Sample Constraints:<br>
- students should not be required to write two exams at the same time.<br>
- sunday Constraint<br>
- The examinations must be well spaced over the timetable<br>
- Examinations with a large number of students must be scheduled early in theexamination timetable.<br>
- Some examinations may have to be scheduled simultaneously or after other exams<br>
- The number of students writing examinations in a particular venue and sessionmust not exceed the capacity of the venue.<br>
- Each student has a schedule of exams he/she must attend<br>
- Each room has multiple features, such room size<br>
- Each exam has a set of required features including the number of studentsattending it<br>
- Rooms can only accommodate exams if they have enough seats to fit all the attending students and have at least all the features required for the exam.<br>

### INPUT<br>
Number of students(each course)<br>
Number of students for a particular exam<br>
Number of classes<br>
Capacity of classes<br>
Number of exams<br>
Name of the exams<br>
Type of exam<br>
Starting Date of the exam<br>

### TECHNIQUE / IDEA TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
- Getting sequence of input from the user or from a file.<br>
- Analysing the input using search algorithms.<br>
- Using file storing technology for maintaining the input and processed data.<br>
- Understanding the problems and dividing into sub problems.<br>
- SLT-modifying algorithm is used to add , delete and update the data.<br>
- Using formatting and arranging methods improving user interface(input and output).<br>
- Printing the university exam time table as the output.<br>
